# chatGPT_llama_index_bot

The code is an example of a chatbot built using the llama_index package and the OpenAI GPT language model. The chatbot function prompts the user for input and returns a response generated by the GPT model, based on the contents of the index.json file that was created using the GPTSimpleVectorIndex class.

The code first imports the necessary packages, including the GPTSimpleVectorIndex class for creating the index, the SimpleDirectoryReader for reading in a directory of data to use for training the model, and the os package for setting environment variables.

Next, it sets the OpenAI API key to an empty string for security purposes.

Then, it loads data from a directory using SimpleDirectoryReader and creates a simple vector index using GPTSimpleVectorIndex. The index is saved to disk as a JSON file using save_to_disk.

After that, the code defines a chatbot() function that continuously prompts the user for input and returns a response generated by the GPT model using query().

Finally, the chatbot() function is called to run the chatbot.
